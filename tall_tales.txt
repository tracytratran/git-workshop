Neils Bohr was awarded a gold medal with the Nobel Prize. He took an active part in the resistance when the Nazis invaded Denmark. When he had to flee Denmark in 1943, he dissolved the medal in acid and hid the bottle. On his return to Copenhagen he retrieved the bottle, precipitated the gold and had the medal recast.

George Gamow deplored the restrictive state of science in the Soviet Union, and sought desperately to defect. The first time he tried, he and his wife attempted to kayak by themselves over 250 km over the Black Sea. The second time was equally ambitious - from Murmansk to Norway, about 2000 km away. Both attempts failed because of poor weather forcing them to turn back.
